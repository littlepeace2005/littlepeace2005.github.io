    <h2>Here and There</h2>

    <p>It was a rainy night in September. The streets were unusually calm under the dark sky. Fine drizzle softly tapped the car window, forming a delicate veil. Jing sat in the car, her gaze fixed on the warm lights of the storefronts ahead. Distant traffic murmured at the city’s edge, like an echo drifting from another world.</p>

    <p>She glanced at her fifteen-year-old son Everett in the rear-view mirror. He was absorbed in his phone, not yet aware of the quiet storm brewing inside her. She took a deep breath, opened the car door and motioned for him to get out together. The rain stretched the glow of the streetlights, filling the air with a moist scent, mingled with the earthy smell of fallen leaves. In the more than twenty years she had lived in Vancouver, White Rock wasn’t a place she frequented, but the café here always had a quiet, inviting warmth—perfect for reunion and farewells.</p>

    <p>She pushed the café door open, and a wave of warmth hit her, laced with the comforting scent of coffee and fresh bread, as if trying to pull her out of the rain. She led Everett toward their reserved table, but he appeared indifferent to where they were headed. The lights around floated and blurred in the misty haze outside. They sat down across one another. Her fingers drummed on the table, blending with the raindrops against the window, higgledy-piggledy. The polished wood of the chairs, the frames on the walls, and the soft murmur of other diners all faded into a distant background, barely registering.</p>

    <p>The door opened again. A gust of cold, rain-soaked air swept in. Jing’s heart clenched. Not needing to turn around, she already knew who arrived.</p>

    <p>“Jing.”</p>

    <p>The sound, laden with the weight of years, landed softly in her. She looked up slowly. She saw him, Ming. He appeared just as in her memories, yet softened, blurred slightly by time. In his thoughtful eyes, that unmistakable warmth still showed.</p>

    <p>“It’s been a long time,” Jing offered a faint smile.</p>

    <p>“Yes, it has.”</p>

    <p>Their eyes met for a moment. Jing thought to herself, was it foolish, after all this time, to still feel this way? The light caught the sharp edges of Ming’s face, then settled over Jing’s short, dark hair with a quiet warmth. The air felt suspended. Only the soft patter of rain filled the stillness, stretching quietly into every corner.</p>

    <p>Jing glanced past Ming at the young girl standing behind him—Ming’s daughter, Mia, a fourteen-year-old from Beijing, about to start high school here. Mia’s eyes sparkled with youthful shyness and curiosity, and her cute, refined features carried a natural poise. Coffee-brown hair cascaded past her shoulders, with a few strands resting playfully on the collar of her light grey hoodie.</p>

    <p>The four of them sat down. Mia tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, while her eyes drifted around the room before landing on Everett. The clean lines on his face and relaxed posture gave him an easy, quiet confidence. As Mia and Everett introduced themselves, a server arrived, placing down four cups of coffee Jing had ordered for everyone.</p>

    <p>Jing nudged a cup toward Ming. “Still black right?”</p>

    <p>Ming nodded, lifting the cup to his lips. “You’ve been here so long,” he said, “Feels like home yet?”</p>

    <p>“It does, more or less.” She hesitated. “And Beijing? Still the same?”</p>

    <p>“You know Beijing. It never really changes.” He glanced at Mia again, a faint crease forming between his brows. “But it’s different when your kid’s halfway across the world. She swore she could handle everything her own, but…”</p>

    <p>“Yeah, hard to believe they grow up so fast.” Jing took a breath. “Time flies, doesn’t it?”</p>

    <p>Her words hung in the air. The table fell into another quiet lull. Everett and Mia looked at each other. They both saw unspoken questions on each other’s faces, but neither pushed for answers.</p>

    <p>Ming raised his cup. “Not often we’re together like this. Let’s…”</p>

    <p>The four cups met in a clink, crisp and light. In that instant, Ming’s fingers brushed against Jing’s—a fleeting touch, warm, casual, yet delicate. What this evening might have been like if they were different people, Jing had been imagining all day, if they could linger after dinner, maybe wander down to a quiet bar for a few drinks, laughing over old stories and pretending, just for a night, that the years hadn’t come between them. But the thought began to dissolve almost as quickly as it came. Ming was here to settle his daughter; Jing had her own life, her own responsibilities. She lowered her gaze to her coffee cup, its dark surface rippling faintly with her movement.</p>

    <p>It’d been a summer at high school. Morning sunlight angled through the classroom windows and spilled onto the desks. The girl always arrived a few minutes early, quietly leaving an origami star she carefully folded by the boy’s notebook. It laid silently on the desk. The boy didn’t need to ask; these offerings were their quiet ritual.</p>

    <p>That evening after study hours, darkness had dissolved the campus. Under a ginkgo tree, the air held the faint scent of its leaves, and its shadows stretched long in the streetlights’ glow. She looked down at their shadows, a wisp of hair lifting in the breeze. The stillness was so complete that even their breathing could be heard.</p>

    <p>Finally, to him, she had spoken, “My dad says… we might be moving abroad soon.”</p>

    <p>The boy had stopped. “Moving abroad” felt so distant to him. But faced with her family’s choice, he couldn’t understand; he only stayed silent.</p>

    <p>“Will you miss this place?”</p>

    <p>She hadn’t answered right away but nodded simply. Under the night sky, the tree and they stood together quietly.</p>

    <p>It’d been a few days later. Cicadas droned in the fading light of evening. The boy stood under that tree, watching the sun dip behind the cityscape. Summer drawing to a close, birds were migrating aloft, vanishing into the distant blue.</p>

    <p>The cups settled back onto the table. Ming skimmed the menu and then glanced up at Jing. “You’ve been here forever. Got any recommendations?” he asked with a faint smile.</p>

    <p>“Okay. But don’t set the bar too high,” Jing answered, “This is as good as it gets in White Rock for cafés, but honestly, the food’s just...so-so.”</p>

    <p>“Really? I think the sandwiches look decent,” Mia said as she scanned the options.</p>

    <p>“Dry bread, sad fillings—meh, classic fare for Westernized people. The Kurobuta Pork Xiao Long Bao at Din Tai Fung are way better than these,” Everett said.</p>

    <p>“Then why’d you order it?” Mia shot him a sidelong glance.</p>

    <p>“Habit,” Everett shrugged. “Sometimes you just order something because it’s familiar. Doesn’t mean it’s good—it’s just…what you do.”</p>

    <p>Ming looked at Jing for a moment. “Remember that café near campus? The one with the mismatched chairs and terrible boba?” He asked.</p>

    <p>“You mean the one with the cat that always sat by the window,” Jing said.</p>

    <p>“Yeah. You hated the boba, but you always ordered it anyway.”</p>

    <p>“Because you always said it was better the second time,” Jing replied, managing a small smile. “It never was.”</p>

    <p>Ming nodded, turning back to the menu. “Maybe the soup here has a chance, then.”</p>

    <p>“It might. Things change.”</p>

    <p>The food came out pretty quickly.</p>

    <p>“Does it always rain here around this time of year?” Mia asked.</p>

    <p>“Pretty much, more in November. But you’ll get used to it after a while like me,” Jing said, “Been here so long I can’t even remember the last time I went back to Beijing. Winters there don’t get as much rain, do they?”</p>

    <p>“Not as much. But the air? Nowhere near this clean and fresh.” Ming sighed, leaning back in his chair. “Rain slows everything down. It’s nice, in a way.”</p>

    <p>“But Sir, I bet give it a few weeks you’ll be bored out of your mind,” Everett said jokingly.</p>

    <p>“You who grew up here don’t realize how lucky you are to have this ‘boring’ life,” Ming said, shaking his head with a wry smile, “In China, if you’re not hustling 24/7, you’re falling behind. So brutal.”</p>

    <p>“Facts,” Mia said, “You got no clue how much pressure I dealt with.”</p>

    <p>Jing just listened in silence, unsure what to add. She’d once thought moving abroad would free her from hometown’s relentless pace, only to find herself breathless trying to keep up with a whole new world. “To be honest, I envy you sometimes,” she said to Ming, “China’s developed so fast. You must’ve had so many opportunities. Coming here, I wasn’t even sure I’d survive.”</p>

    <p>“You envy me?” Ming frowned, “I’ve always wondered what life would’ve been like if I had the chance to leave, like you did. Maybe things would’ve been much easier.”</p>

    <p>“Easier?” Jing’s mind flashed back to her first autumn here.</p>

    <p>The wind in Canada had been icy. She and her parents crammed into a small apartment with the smell of old carpet. They borrowed money to open a small Chinese restaurant, working tirelessly day to day. As the one most fluent in English, she handled everything from utility bills to customer complaints. She had to grow up fast.</p>

    <p>When she’d started college, homesickness had hit ever harder. She missed Beijing’s alleyways, its loud, bustling streets. Her prestigious university felt hollow—just a mountain of student loans looming over her. Late at night, she scrolled through the news of hometown online: subway lines extending, skyscrapers climbing higher. Everything there was evolving, while she was stuck in place. She resented her parents for bringing her here. But there was no going back. All she could do was study harder and return to the kitchen, where piles of greasy plates waited.</p>

    <p>“When we first moved here, my mom and dad worked themselves to the bone just to keep us afloat. I ended up washing dishes to help out. I really thought at that time that...” Jing trailed off, as she realized there was no point explaining. People who hadn’t lived through it would never understand its cost. For years, she avoided reconnecting with people from her past, seeing her life as a betrayal of who she once was.</p>

    <p>“Well, at least you got out,” Ming said, “You’ve seen a world so different from ours, building a life here, a successful one. I’ve always been so afraid—afraid that leaving would just wreck everything.”</p>

    <p>“But isn’t China developing even faster?” Jing asked, glancing at Everett. “Last time he came back from Beijing, he said the downtown at night looked straight out of a sci-fi movie. I was like, ‘There’s no way it’s the Beijing I left.’”</p>

    <p>“Wait. Everett, you’ve been there?” Mia asked, her eyes widening.</p>

    <p>“Ev went on his own. He loved that city,” Jing said, “He used to be really uninterested in the Chinese culture while I forced him to go to weekend language school. But funny enough: after that trip, we happened to be moving to West Van, and as per neighborhood tradition we needed to name the new house. Guess what? He was hell-bent on calling it the ‘Summer Palace’ to make it apart from the rest.” She laughed, then added, “Sometimes, you gotta see a place to really get it. He realized China’s nothing like the clichés they hear about in the West, right?”</p>

    <p>“Very different,” Everett replied, “It’s not some closed-off world. It’s full of cool skateboarding kids in streetwear like you,” He turned to Mia. “And, of course, the elite in suits like your dad.” He added with a grin toward Ming.</p>

    <p>“Who are you calling a kid?” Mia teased.</p>

    <p>“All I’m saying is, it’s nothing like us ‘bumpkins.’”</p>

    <p>Beijing’s nights indeed feel so alive. The skyscrapers glowed cold and bright. But behind every light was always a desk, a tired person, weighed down with unfinished work—Jing never knew—how many people there had dreamed of escaping.</p>

    <p>Ming chuckled wryly. Sending Mia abroad was the last move left in his playbook: giving his daughter the freedom he never quite managed to claim for himself.</p>

    <p>Outside, the rain had stopped. Droplets slid down the windows in faint streaks, like a thin veil, blurring the neon signs. Jing glanced at Ming and found him looking back at her. Their eyes met, a thousand unspoken words about to rise to the surface. But then, as if by some agreement, they both fell silent. Some things, no matter how many times revisited, could never bridge the years. The gap was too wide to close in a single night. They’d both changed too much, tethered to separate lives. For the two adults, this thought was as lamentable as it was comforting, silence saying as much as any words might.</p>

    <p>Everett looked quietly at them, then over at Mia. He wanted to say something, but stopped himself. Mia caught the look and gave him a slight shrug. They didn’t need to ask; they weren’t children anymore.</p>

    <p>The meal was coming to an end. Ming set down his cup. “It’s late. I got an early flight tomorrow—heading back to Beijing.”</p>

    <p>“Yeah, it’s about time to go.”</p>

    <p>The two of them split the bill and stepped out into the night. The door shut behind them, cutting off the hum of the café. The air was fresh and cool. They stood at the corner by their parked cars, none of them moving to leave just yet.</p>

    <p>After what felt like an eternity, Everett finally turned to Mia and asked, “Will you miss your hometown?”</p>

    <p>“Maybe,” Mia replied, “Or maybe not. More than the past, I just want to see what’s ahead.”</p>

    <p>Jing and Ming simply stood, watching the younger two with a quiet hope. They believed that the two of them would go farther than they ever could.</p>

    <p>Jing’s gaze shifted to Ming. “She’s right. What’s ahead is what matters.”</p>

    <p>“It is.”</p>

    <p>The streetlights cast a soft glow on the glistening sidewalk. Somewhere, in the reflections of rainwater, their four shadows overlapped, faint and scattered—like fragments of some memories drifted apart and merged again.</p>
