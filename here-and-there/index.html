        <h1>Here and There</h1>
        <p>It was a rainy night in September. The streets were unusually quiet under the night sky. Fine drizzle softly tapped the car window, forming a delicate veil. Jing sat in the car, her gaze fixed on the warm amber lights of the shops and restaurants ahead. Some distant car horns, occasionally, sounded far-off and solitary at the edge of the city, like an echo drifting from another world, distant and haunting.</p>
        <p>She glanced at Everett in the rear-view mirror. Her son was absorbed in his phone, not yet aware of the quiet storm brewing inside her. She took a deep breath, opening the car door and stepping out with her son. The rain stretched the glow of the streetlights, filling the air with a moist scent mingled with the faint, earthy smell of fallen leaves. White Rock wasn’t a place she frequented, but the café here always had a quiet, inviting warmth—perfect for farewells, also perfect for gatherings.</p>
        <p>She pushed the café door open, and a wave of warmth hit her, laced with the comforting scent of coffee and fresh bread, as if trying to pull her out of the rain. She led Everett toward their reserved table, but Everett appeared indifferent to where they were headed. The lights around floated and blurred in the misty haze outside. Her fingers drummed on the table, blending with the raindrops against the window, higgledy-piggledy. The polished wood of the chairs, the frames on the walls, and the soft murmur of other diners all faded into a distant background, barely registering.</p>
        <p>The door opened again. A gust of cold, rain-soaked air swept in. Jing’s heart clenched. Not needing to turn around, she already knew who arrived.</p>
        <p>“Jing.”</p>
        <p>The sound, laden with the weight of years, landed softly in her. She looked up slowly. She saw him, Ming. He appeared just as in her memories, yet softened, blurred slightly by time. In his thoughtful eyes, that unmistakable warmth still showed.</p>
        <p>“It’s been a long time,” Jing offered a faint smile.</p>
        <p>“Yes, it has.”</p>
        <p>Their eyes met for a moment. The light caught the sharp edges of Ming’s face, then settled over Jing’s short, dark hair with a quiet warmth. The air felt suspended. Only the soft patter of rain filled the stillness, stretching quietly into every corner.</p>
        <p>“This is my daughter, Mia. She’s starting high school soon,” Ming first broke the silence.</p>
        <p>Mia nodded politely, eyes sparkling with youthful shyness and curiosity. Her cute, refined features carried a natural poise. Coffee-brown hair cascaded past her shoulders, with a few strands resting playfully on the collar of her light grey hoodie.</p>
        <p>“Hi, Mia. My son, Everett,” Jing said, “You just got here, right? How are you adapting?”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, just got here. Everything’s still pretty new. And the rainy weather’s so different than Beijing,” Mia said, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. Her eyes drifted around the room before landing on Everett, whose clean lines and relaxed posture gave him an easy, quiet confidence.</p>
        <p>Everett smiled, “Hey, I’m Ev. I’m going to attend high school too. Welcome to Raincouver.”</p>
        <p>Laughter broke out around the table. But the moment it faded, silence returned. A server arrived, placing down four cups of coffee Jing had ordered for everyone.</p>
        <p>Ming lifted his coffee cup, took a slow sip, and asked, “So, are you still based in Vancouver?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, been here for long. I guess I’ve... finally gotten used to it,” Jing paused, then added, “And you? How’s everything there in Beijing?”</p>
        <p>“It’s fine, as ever. Nothing’s really changed.” Ming stole a glance at his daughter before continuing. “Now that Mia’s starting school here, she said she’d be able to settle in by herself, but I figured I’d best come here and help her a bit...”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, hard to believe they grow up so fast.” Jing took a breath. “Time flies, doesn’t it?”</p>
        <p>Her words hung in the air. The table fell into another quiet lull. Everett and Mia looked at each other. They both saw their unspoken questions on the other’s face, but neither pushed for answers.</p>
        <p>Ming raised his cup. “Not often we’re together like this. Let’s…”</p>
        <p>The four cups met in a clink, crisp and light. In that instant, Ming’s fingers brushed against Jing’s, unintentionally—a fleeting touch, warm, casual, yet delicate. The coffee in their cups rippled slightly, mirroring their silhouettes, like shadows entwined across the years, softened and blurred.</p>
        <p>It’d been a summer. Morning sunlight had angled through the classroom windows and spilled onto the desks. The girl had always arrived a few minutes early, quietly leaving an origami star she carefully folded by the boy’s notebook. They had lain silently on the page. The boy hadn’t needed to ask; these offerings were their quiet ritual.</p>
        <p>That evening after study hours, darkness had dissolved the campus. Under a ginkgo tree, the air had held the faint scent of its leaves, and its shadows had stretched long in the streetlights’ glow. She’d looked down at their shadows, a wisp of hair lifting in the breeze. The stillness had been so complete that even their breathing could be heard.</p>
        <p>Finally, to him, she had spoken, “My dad says… we might be moving abroad soon.”</p>
        <p>The boy had stopped. “Moving abroad” had felt so distant, like a stone sinking into a lake, the ripples fading even before reaching the surface. Faced with her family’s choice, he couldn’t understand; he’d only stayed silent.</p>
        <p>“Will you miss this place?”</p>
        <p>She hadn’t answered right away but nodded simply. Under the night sky, the tree and they had stood quiet.</p>
        <p>It had been a few days later. Cicadas had droned in the fading light of evening. The boy had stood under that tree, watching the sun dip behind the cityscape. Summer drawing to a close, birds had been migrating aloft, vanishing into the distant blue.</p>
        <p>The cups settled back onto the table. The awkwardness lingered for a moment but slowly began to fade. Ming skimmed the menu and then glanced up at Jing. “You’ve been here forever. Got any recommendations?” he asked with a faint smile.</p>
        <p>“Okay. But don’t set the bar too high,” Jing answered peacefully, “This is as good as it gets in White Rock for cafés, but honestly, the food’s just...so-so.”</p>
        <p>“Really? I think the sandwiches look decent,” Mia said as she scanned the options.</p>
        <p>“Dry bread, sad fillings—meh, classic fare for Westernized people. The Kurobuta Pork Xiao Long Bao at Din Tai Fung are way better than these,” Everett said.</p>
        <p>“Then why’d you order it?” Mia shot him a sidelong glance.</p>
        <p>“Habit,” Everett shrugged, “Sometimes you just order something because it’s familiar. Doesn’t mean it’s good—it’s just…what you do.”</p>
        <p>Ming looked at Jing for a moment. “Remember that café near campus? The one with the mismatched chairs and terrible boba?” He asked.</p>
        <p>“You mean the one with the cat that always sat by the window,” Jing said.</p>
        <p>“Yeah. You hated that, but you always ordered it anyway.”</p>
        <p>“Because you always said it was better the second time,” Jing replied, managing a small smile. “It never was.”</p>
        <p>Ming nodded, turning back to the menu. “Maybe the soup here has a chance, then.”</p>
        <p>“It might. Things change.”</p>
        <p>The food came out pretty quickly.</p>
        <p>“Does it ever stop raining in Vancouver in falls?” Mia asked.</p>
        <p>“Sometimes,” Jing said, “But I’ve just got used to it. Been here so long I can’t even remember the last time I went back to Beijing. Winters there don’t get as much rain, do they?”</p>
        <p>“Not as much. But the air? Nowhere near this clean and fresh.” Ming sighed, leaning back in his chair. “Rain slows everything down. It’s nice, in a way.”</p>
        <p>“But Sir, I bet give it a few weeks you’ll be bored out of your mind,” Everett said jokingly.</p>
        <p>“You who grew up here don’t realize how lucky you are to have this ‘boring’ life,” Ming said, shaking his head with a wry smile, “In China, imagine you’re a normal person: if you’re not hustling 24/7, you’re falling behind. So brutal.”</p>
        <p>“Facts,” Mia said, “You probably got no clue how much pressure I dealt with as I grew as a local Beijinger.”</p>
        <p>Jing just listened in silence, unsure what to add. She’d once thought moving abroad would free her from hometown’s relentless pace, only to find herself breathless trying to keep up with a whole new world. “To be honest, I envy you sometimes,” she said finally, “China’s developed so fast. You must’ve had so many opportunities. Back then coming here, I wasn’t even sure I’d survive.”</p>
        <p>“You envy me?” Ming frowned, “I’ve always wondered what life would’ve been like if I had the chance to leave, like you did. Maybe things would’ve been much easier.”</p>
        <p>“Easier?” Jing’s mind flashed back to nothing but her first autumn in here.</p>
        <p>The wind in Canada had been icy. She and her parents had crammed into a small apartment with the smell of old carpet. They’d borrowed money to open a small Chinese restaurant, working tirelessly day to day. As the one most fluent in English, she’d handled everything from utility bills to customer complaints. She’d been a student by day, an adult by necessity.</p>
        <p>When she’d started college, homesickness had hit ever harder. She’d missed Beijing’s alleyways, its loud, bustling streets. Her prestigious university had felt hollow—just a mountain of student loans looming over her. Late at night, she’d scroll through the news of hometown online: subway lines extending, skyscrapers climbing higher. Everything there had been evolving, while she’d been stuck in place. She’d resented her parents for bringing her here. But there’d been no going back. All she could do was study harder and return to the kitchen, where piles of greasy plates had waited.</p>
        <p>“When we first moved here, my mom and dad worked themselves to the bone just to keep us afloat. I ended up washing dishes to help out. I really thought at that time that...” Jing trailed off, as she realized there was no point explaining. People who hadn’t lived through it would never understand the cost of it. For years, therefore, she avoided reconnecting with people from her past, seeing her life as a betrayal of who she once was.</p>
        <p>“Well, at least you got out,” Ming said, “You’ve seen a world so different from ours, building a life here, a successful one. I’ve always been so afraid—afraid that leaving would just wreck everything.”</p>
        <p>“But isn’t China developing even faster?” Jing asked, glancing at Everett. “Last time he came back from Beijing, he said the CBD at night looked straight out of a sci-fi movie. I thought, ‘There’s no way it’s the Beijing I left.’”</p>
        <p>“Wait. Everett, you’ve been to Beijing?” Mia asked, her eyes widening.</p>
        <p>“Ev went on his own. He loved that city,” Jing said, “He used to be really uninterest in the Chinese culture while I forced him to go to weekend language school. But funny enough: after that trip, we happened to be moving to West Van, and we needed to name the new house. Guess what? He was hell-bent on calling it the ‘Summer Palace’ to make it apart from the rest.” She laughed, then added, “Sometimes, you gotta see a place to really get it. He realized China’s nothing like the clichés they hear about in the West, right?”</p>
        <p>“Very different,” Everett replied, “It’s not some closed-off world. It’s full of cool skateboarding kids in streetwear like you,” He turned to Mia, “And, of course, the elite in suits like your dad.” He added with a grin toward Ming.</p>
        <p>“Who are you calling a kid?” Mia teased.</p>
        <p>“All I’m saying is, it’s nothing like us bumpkins.”</p>
        <p>Ming chuckled wryly. Beijing’s nights... They always feel so alive, don’t they? The skyscrapers glowed cold and bright. But behind every light was always a desk, a tired person, fingers racing over keyboards, weighed down with unfinished work. This was the core of the metropolis—a battleground for power and capital, and for ambition and burnout.</p>
        <p>Ming, of course, had grown used to it. His life followed a path mapped out: a degree, a steady job, and a respectable existence. As his calendar was filled with endless dinners and meetings, his choices had quietly shrunk. Looking out at the towering buildings, he couldn’t help but wonder how many others had also dreamed of escaping.</p>
        <p>But escape wasn’t an option anymore—the life laid out locked him into what he couldn’t afford to stray from. He glanced at Jing and Everett, his thoughts lingering around words he’d never say. Sending Mia abroad was the last move left in his playbook: giving his daughter the freedom he never quite managed to claim for himself.</p>
        <p>Outside, the rain had stopped. Droplets slid down the windows in faint streaks, like a thin veil, blurring the neon signs. Jing glanced at Ming and found him looking back at her. Their eyes met, a thousand unspoken words about to rise to the surface. But then, as if by some agreement, they both fell silent. Some things, no matter how many times revisited, could never bridge the years. The gap was too wide, too heavy to close in a single night. They’d both changed too much, their silence saying as much as any words might.</p>
        <p>Everett looked quietly at them, then over at Mia. He wanted to say something, but eventually stopped himself. Mia caught the look and gave him a slight shrug. They didn’t need to ask; they weren’t children anymore.</p>
        <p>The meal was coming to an end. Ming set down his cup, “It’s late. I got an early flight tomorrow—heading back to Beijing.”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, it’s about time to go.”</p>
        <p>The four of them paid the bill and stepped out into the night. The door shut behind them, cutting off the hum of the café. The damp air was fresh and cool. They stood at the corner by their parked cars, none of them moving to leave just yet.</p>
        <p>After what felt like an eternity, Everett finally turned to Mia and asked, “You’ll have to be living here alone. Will you miss your hometown?”</p>
        <p>“Maybe.” Mia replied. “Or maybe not. More than the past, I just want to see what’s ahead.”</p>
        <p>Jing and Ming simply stood, watching the younger two with a quiet hope. They believed that the two of them would go farther than they ever could.</p>
        <p>Jing’s gaze shifted to Ming. “She’s right. What’s ahead is what matters.”</p>
        <p>“It is.”</p>
        <p>The streetlights cast a soft glow on the glistening sidewalk. Somewhere, in the reflections of rainwater, their four shadows overlapped, faint and scattered—like fragments of some memories drifted apart and merged again.</p>
