												<h4>[Unfinished] Story for My Original Character Ollie: Rose Up From the Ashes (Excerpt)</h4>
												<blockquote>
												<p>It had rained just now, and the pavement was yet filled with puddles. In a pair of soaking sneakers, Ollie was plodding home. Despite few friends walking abreast of him, he’d never felt much lonesome. The moist zephyr, smelling of rain, sent the torrid summer away for a little while. Ollie felt somewhat relaxed. Though not really a solitary type, he seemed as if he had been used to it.</p>
												<p>The door swung open a crack, “anyone’s there?” and quickly, as Ollie came in, it closed.</p>
												<p>“How’s the first week, mate?” A boy’s voice, with his crunching, floated through the air. His name was Matt.</p>
												<p>“Fine…” Answered offhandedly.</p>
												<p>“Typical. School sucks, I know.” Matt stepped out of the main bedroom with a cookie jar, “anyway, biscuits?” He held out a cookie from it while chewing another one.</p>
												<p>“No thanks. Well…” Ollie ran his eyes thoughtfully over the old glass jar. The butter cookies had since been replaced by chocolate ones. He liked cookies actually, and yet, somehow, he rarely took them anymore when he grew up.</p>
												<p>Then without uttering a word, Ollie stepped and stepped deeply, turned into a backroom, the personal space of his, and locked the wooden door. Matt, meanwhile, studied Ollie dumbly—soaked sneakers, stained jeans, and a plain t-shirt—throughout the silence, watching Ollie’s figure dissolving into the room. His time seemed frozen in a livelong second and, afterward, flowed a tempo as he dropped his gaze gradually off that direction.</p>
												<p>In his room, Ollie put down his schoolbag into a corner and then reclined on his bed. Raindrops streaked the glass panes, along the exterior surface, tardily. Leaning against the headboard, he, through the window in the vague, stared out at the clouded sky. Rains again? He couldn’t tell. Anyway, the rainwater was still dripping from the eaves. Maybe…drizzling? He tried hard to listen, to see if it were lightly raining. Nevertheless, aside from the bustle outside, mixed with an intermittent patter on the roof, nothing else could he hear. Such ambience, on the other hand, like a lullaby, put him gradually into a deep daze. Grey sky with a spattering of drizzling, maybe at his remembrance, Ollie seemed like disorientated somewhere. He felt it vaguely familiar, and yet he couldn’t say where he was. Everything was so indistinct that he couldn’t focus his eyes on anything there. The harder he tried, the faster everything blurred… </p>
